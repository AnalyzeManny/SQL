Morty Schapiro,	I heard a gunshot and then saw a man run out. He had a "Get Fit Now Gym" bag. The membership number on 
the bag started with "48Z". Only gold members have those bags. The man got into a car with a plate that included "H42W".
Annabel Miller,	I saw the murder happen, and I recognized the killer from my gym when I was working out last week on January the 9th.--
